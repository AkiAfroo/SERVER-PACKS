*You can choose whatever of this ones.*
*All of they are Ovepoch*
*Check The mod list and credits file*

**HOW TO INSTALL**

1.Create a database called "overpoch2018" with his username: "overpoch2018" and his pass: "overpoch2018". (we gonna use that names cuz is the value for default that i put. You can change it later.)

**2.A.**Create a fresh server files in C:\overpoch\  
(We gonna use that path cuz its already defined in server files,other way you gonna need edit a lot).
**2.B.**Do not put @DayZ_Epoch_Server and MPMissions folder provided by epoch. we gonna use our owns.
So basically in this step you jsut need drop all content from your arma2 and arma2oa in one single folder.
